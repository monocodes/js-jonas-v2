/* 
// CHALLENGE #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meters).

// Your task is to write some code to help them:

// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables called massMark, heightMark, massJohn and heightJohn.

// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in two variables called BMIMark and BMIJohn.

// 3. Log the value of BMIMark and BMIJohn to the console.

// 4. BONUS: Create a boolean variable markHigherBMI containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. Log it to the console too

// TEST DATA 1: Marks weighs 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weighs 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

// TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

// ðŸ‘‹ OPTIONAL: You can watch my solution in video format in the next lecture

// IMPORTANT: The ** operator is not supported in this editor. Please make sure to use exactly this formula mass / (height * height), and not this one mass / (height ** 2).

// Test data 1
// const massMark = 78;
// const heightMark = 1.69;
// const massJohn = 92;
// const heightJohn = 1.95;

// Test data 2
const massMark = 95;
const heightMark = 1.88;
const massJohn = 85;
const heightJohn = 1.76;

const BMIMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
const BMIJohn = massJohn / heightJohn ** 2;

console.log(BMIMark, BMIJohn);

const markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn;
console.log(markHigherBMI);

// Challenge #2
/* 
// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

// 1. Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The message can be either:

// "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".

// 2. Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the outputs.

// Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" or "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!".

// Note: Don't round the BMI values. Leave them as they are.

// ðŸ‘‹ OPTIONAL: You can watch my solution in video format in the next lecture

// IMPORTANT: The ** operator is not supported in this editor. Please make sure to use exactly this formula mass / (height * height), and not this one mass / (height ** 2).

const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const massJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

const BMIMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
const BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
console.log(BMIMark, BMIJohn);

if (BMIMark > BMIJohn) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${BMIMark}) is higher than John's (${BMIJohn})!`);
} else
  console.log(`John's BMI (${BMIJohn}) is higher than Mark's (${BMIMark})`);
